# 2018 - Texas Senate Elections

Project to analyze tweets about Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke leading up to the 2018 senate election.

The Twitter-data-retrieval jupyter notebook retrieved data from the Twitter API every day from 6th October to 14th October . The data is aggregated, tidyied, and saved in .csv format.

The Twitter-data-analysis jupyter notebook reads in the .csv data and performs exploratory analysis to ensure the integrity of the data. The temporal variations in the data are explored for insights about how twitter activity correlates to election events.

Also implemented sentiment analysis and topic modelling to understand the topics that are resonating with the public for both the candidates.
